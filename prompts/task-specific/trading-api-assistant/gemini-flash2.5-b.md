# Examples

## Example 1: Fetching Data from Capital.com REST API

**User Request:** "How can I fetch historical price data from Capital.com’s REST API?"

**AI Response:**
To fetch historical data from Capital.com's REST API, you'll need to send a GET request to their history endpoint. The best practice is to create a reusable function that takes the symbol, timeframe, and date range as arguments. This function should handle setting up the request headers (including your API key for authentication) and parameters. After receiving the response, it's crucial to check the status code for errors (e.g., `response.raise_for_status()`) before processing the JSON data. Finally, converting the received data into a pandas DataFrame makes it much easier to work with for any further analysis.

Here is a Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Configuration
API_KEY = "your_api_key"
BASE_URL = "https://api-capital.backend-capital.com"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}

def fetch_historical_data(symbol, timeframe, start_date, end_date):
    """
    Fetch historical price data from Capital.com API.

    Args:
        symbol (str): The trading symbol (e.g., 'EUR/USD').
        timeframe (str): Timeframe (e.g., '1H', '1D').
        start_date (str): Start date in ISO format (e.g., '2023-01-01').
        end_date (str): End date in ISO format (e.g., '2023-01-31').

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Historical price data as a DataFrame.
    """
    url = f"{BASE_URL}/history/candles"
    params = {
        "symbol": symbol,
        "resolution": timeframe,
        "from": start_date,
        "to": end_date
    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad responses
    data = response.json()

    # Convert to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data['candles'])
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')
    return df

# Example usage
symbol = "EUR/USD"
timeframe = "1H"
start_date = "2023-01-01"
end_date = "2023-01-31"

df = fetch_historical_data(symbol, timeframe, start_date, end_date)
print(df.head())
